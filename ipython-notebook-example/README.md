# SigOpt IPython Notebook Example

Here we use SigOpt to optimze a simple 2D function within an [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

We create an experiment, form the suggestion feedback loop to optimize the function, then visualize the results against several other methods.

You can modify this notebook to optimize any function.

## Setup
1. Get a free SigOpt account at https://sigopt.com/signup
2. Find your `client_token` on your [user profile](https://sigopt.com/user/profile).
3. Insert your `client_token` into sigopt_creds.py
4. Run `sudo ./setup_env.sh`

## Run
```
