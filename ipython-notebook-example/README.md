SigOpt IPython Notebook Example
-------------------------------

Here we give an example of using SigOpt to optimze a simple 2D function within an ipython notebook.

We create an experiment, form the suggestion feedback loop, and visualize the results against several other methods.

You can modify this notebook to optimize any function. Sign up for your free trial of SigOpt [here](https://sigopt.com/signup).
