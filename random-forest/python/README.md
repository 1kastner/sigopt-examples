# SigOpt Random Forest Python Example

This example tunes a random forest using SigOpt + Python on the IRIS dataset. We offer:
 * Python API Client Example
 * Notebook Version of Python API Client Example
 * SigOpt + scikit-learn Integration Example

## Python
Add your SigOpt [API token](https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/authentication) in line 16 of `random_forest.py`, then run the following code in a terminal to install dependencies and execute the script:

```
pip install sigopt
pip install sklearn
python random_forest.py
```

Learn more about our [Python API Client](https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/python).

## Notebook Version
We have a version of our Python Random Forest Example in a convenient [iPython notebook](https://ipython.org/) form.
To run, start up the notebook and add your SigOpt [API token](https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/authentication) into the first cell. Run cells with `shift + enter`.

To run the notebook:

```
pip install jupyter
pip install sigopt
pip install sklearn
jupyter notebook
```

Learn more about our [Python API Client](https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/python) that we use in the notebook.


## Scikit-learn Integration
Add your SigOpt [API token](https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/authentication) in line 15 of `random_forest.sklearn.py`, then run the following code in a terminal to install dependencies and execute the script:

```
pip install sigopt_sklearn
python random_forest.sklearn.py
```
